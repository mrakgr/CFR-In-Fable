    // I'll do a bit extra today.
    // I got some good advice in the thread I linked to.

    // It seems with .NET 8 preview 3, the problems go away so we'll try that.

    // ...
    // ...
    // ...

    // Let me just show you the commit changes.

    // Anyway, as you could see, I changed the SDK to 8.0.
    // I got 8.0.100-preview.3.23178.7
    // ...that you can see in the terminal. We've already determined that preview 4 is broken previously, so preview 3 is the one you need.
    // After that I also got the specific packages of

    // <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly" Version="8.0.0-preview.3.23177.8" />
    // <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer" Version="8.0.0-preview.3.23177.8" PrivateAssets="all" />
    // <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components" Version="8.0.0-preview.3.23177.8" />

    // We'll what you can see here. One other option is to downgrade to .NET 7.0.202.
    // We'll go with the preview version for now.
    // My, what a mess this was.

    // We'll continue this properly tomorrow. I am glad I got at least this resolved.
    // If you are trying out Blazor at this point in time, aren't you glad you got this far?
